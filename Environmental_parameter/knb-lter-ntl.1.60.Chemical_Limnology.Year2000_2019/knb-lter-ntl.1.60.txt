    2023-08-08      Parameters characterizing the nutrient chemistry of the eleven primary lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, and Trout lakes, unnamed lakes 27-02 [Crystal Bog] and 12-15 [Trout Bog], Mendota, Monona, Wingra, and Fish) are measured at multiple depths throughout the year. These parameters include total nitrogen, total dissolved nitrogen, nitrite+nitrate-N, ammonium-N, total phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus, dissolved reactive phosphorus (only in the southern lakes and not in Wingra and Fish after 2003), bicarbonate-reactive filtered and unfiltered silica (both discontinued in 2003), dissolved reactive silica, pH, air equilibrated pH (discontinued in 2014 in the northern lakes and in 2020 in the southern lakes), total alkalinity, total inorganic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, total organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and total particulate matter (only in the northern lakes in this data set; total particulate matter in southern lakes starting in 2000 is available in a separate dataset). Sampling Frequency: Northern lakes- monthly during ice-free season - every 5 weeks during ice-covered season. Southern lakes- Southern lakes samples are collected every 2-4 weeks during the summer stratified period, at least monthly during the fall, and typically only once during the winter, depending on ice conditions. Number of sites: 11

                  Sample Collection and Storage
          Routine water samples are collected at one station in the deepest part of each lake. 
          Northern lakes- Samples are collected monthly during ice-free periods and every 5 weeks during ice-covered season for the northern lakes. Samples are collected at the top and bottom of the epilimnion, mid-thermocline, and top, middle, and bottom of the hypolimnion. When lakes are not stratified, samples are collected at  the top, middle, and bottom of the water column.  
          Southern lakes- Samples are collected twice a month during spring and the summer stratified period, monthly during the fall, and typically only once during the winter (depending on ice conditions). During the summer, Fish Lake, Lake Mendota, and Lake Monona are sampled in an alternating fashion; full vertical profile sampling is done monthly in these 3 lakes, and epilimnion (0-4) samples are collected monthly, with these two different sampling efforts staggered by two weeks. Nutrient sampling of Lake Wingra is limited to monthly surface sampling only. 
          In all lakes, water is collected from each depth by lowering a tube to the targeted depth and pumping water to the surface with a peristaltic pump and if appropriate, passing this water through a 0.45 micron filter capsule (0.45 micron polycarbonate filter before 2015) prior to filling the appropriate clean sample containers. 
          Total and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon: Samples are collected in 24 ml glass vials, capped with septa, leaving no head space. Samples are stored refrigerated at 4 degrees Celsius until analysis, which should occur within 2-3 weeks. 
          Silica, total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus (filtered and unfiltered)-Northern lakes: 120 ml LDPE bottles filled in the field with filtered and unfiltered water are acidified to a 1 percent HCl matrix by adding 1 ml of ultra pure concentrated HCl to 100 mls of sample. For every sample acidification event, three acid blanks are created by adding the same acid used on the samples to 100 ml ultra pure water supplied from the lab. Once acidified, the samples are stable at room temperature until analysis, which should occur within one year. Until acidification, the samples should be refrigerated at 4 degrees Celsius. 
          Silica, total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus (filtered and unfiltered)-Southern lakes: Analysis of these nutrient fractions is done by both the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (SLOH) and by the NTL Water Chemistry Lab, and varies among lakes and over time. Various constituents have been analyzed for the same lake/depth/date, allowing for lab intercomparison. Total N determination via Kjeldahl N + NO2NO3-N was terminated in 2016 and replaced with direct determination of Total N following a 1.5 year period for intercomparison (see Stanley et al. 2019).
          For lakes Mendota, Monona, and Wingra, 250 ml bottles for TN/TP, NO2NO3-N, and NH4-N; and 60 ml bottles for Si and dissolved reactive phosphorus samples are provided SLOH. These bottles are filled with unfiltered water and the 250 mL bottles are acidified in the lab using ampules of pre-measured volumes of H2SO4 acid provided by SLOH. Note: for non-baseline efforts that involve the collection and analysis of samples for these constituents, the NTL protocols are used for all lakes (i.e., samples are collected and analyzed in house, not by SLOH). 
          Inorganic nitrogen: For NTL lab analysis, 20 ml HDPE plastic containers are filled with ca. 18 ml filtered water and sealed with conical caps. The samples are stored frozen until analysis, which occurs within 6 months. This protocol is also used when samples are collected for dissolved reactive phosphorus and for non-baseline projects.
          pH and millivolts are measured on the Madison lakes during “profile” sampling periods (every 4 weeks during non-ice months, and usually once during ice-on months.  Both air equilibrated and air excluded are conducted for each sample. 
          We measure water column total particulate matter (TPM) monthly during open water at the deepest part of the lake. The sample depths are the same as are used for other water chemistry sample collections. Using a peristaltic pump and tubing, we pump lake water through preweighed 0.45u membrane filters until the filters clog or until we have pumped 500ml. Filters are dried in a 60C drying oven for at least 24 hours, and then weighed on a Sartorius Research analytical balance. Particulates (mg per L) are calculated from the mass on the filter and the volume of lake water filtered.
              Protocol Log: 1986 -- began collecting TPM samples. Filters were weighed in Madison.
              2000 -- began weighing filters at Trout Lake Station. A Cahn Model 31 electrobalance is used.
              2007 -- began using Sartorius Research analytical balance for filter weighing.
              2021 -- discontinued TPM measurement
          Sample Analysis
          Inorganic and organic carbon
          The detection limit for inorganic carbon is 0.15 ppm, and the analytical range for the method is 60 ppm. The detection limit for organic carbon is 0.30 ppm and the analytical range for the method is 30 ppm. Method Log: Prior to May 2006 samples, inorganic carbon was analyzed by phosphoric acid addition on an OI Model 700 Carbon Analyzer. From May 2006, inorganic carbon is still analyzed by phosphoric acid addition, on a Shimadzu TOC-V-csh Total Organic Carbon Analyzer until April 2016. From April 2016 to present, samples have been run on a Shimadzu TOC-L-cph Total Organic Carbon Analyzer. Method Log: Prior to May 2006 samples, organic carbon was analyzed by heated persulfate digestion on an OI Model 700 Carbon Analyzer. From May 2006, organic carbon is analyzed by combustion, on a Shimadzu TOC-V-csh Total Organic Carbon Analyzer until April 2016. From April 2016 to present, samples have been run on a Shimadzu TOC-L-cph Total Organic Carbon Analyzer.
          Dissolved reactive silica
          Dissolved reactive silica is determined by the Heteropoly Blue Method and the absorption is measured at 820 nm. The detection limit for silicon is 6 ppb and the analytical range is 15000 ppb. Method Log These determinations were performed manually using a Bausch and Lomb Spectrophotometer from the beginning of the project until April 1984. From 1984 through 2005, dissolved reactive silicon was determined on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer II. From January 2006 to present, samples are run on an Astoria-Pacific Astoria II AutoAnalyzer.
          Total and total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus
          The samples must first be prepared for analysis by adding an NaOH–Persulfate digestion reagent and heated for an hour at 120 degrees C and 18-20 psi in an autoclave. The samples are analyzed for total nitrogen and total phosphorus simultaneously by automated colorimetric spectrophotometry, using a segmented flow autoanalyzer. Total nitrogen is determined by utilizing the automated cadmium reduction method, as described in Standard Methods, where the absorption is monitored at 520 nm. The detection limit for total and dissolved nitrogen is approximately 21 ppb and the analytical range for the method extends to 2500 ppb. The detection limit for total phosphorus is approximately 3 ppb and the analytical range for the method extends to 800 ppb. Method Log: Prior to January 2006 samples, total nitrogen was determined on a Technicon segmented flow autoanalyzer. From 2006 to present, total nitrogen is determined by an Astoria-Pacific Astoria II segmented flow autoanalyzer.
