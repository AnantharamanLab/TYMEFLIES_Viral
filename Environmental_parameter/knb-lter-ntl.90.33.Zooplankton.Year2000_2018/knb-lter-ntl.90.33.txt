       Zooplankton samples for the 4 southern Wisconsin LTER lakes (Mendota, Monona, Wingra,
        Fish) have been collected for analysis by LTER since 1995 (1996 Wingra, Fish) when the
        southern Wisconsin lakes were added to the North Temperate Lakes LTER project. Samples are
        collected as a vertical tow using an 80-micron mesh conical net with a 30-cm diameter
        opening (net mouth: net length ratio = 1:3) consistent with sampling conducted by the
        Wisconsin Dept. Natural Resources in prior years. Zooplankton tows are taken in the deep
        hole region of each lake at the same time and location as other limnological sampling;
        zooplankton samples are preserved in 70% ethanol for later processing. Samples are usually
        collected with standard tow depths on most dates (e.g., 20 meters for Lake Mendota) but not
        always, so tow depth is recorded as a variate in the database. Crustacean species are
        identified and counted for Mendota and Monona and body lengths are recorded for a portion of
        each species identified (see data protocol for counting procedure); samples for Wingra and
        Fish lakes are archived but not routinely counted. Numerical densities for Mendota and
        Monona zooplankton samples are reported in the database as number or organisms per square
        meter without correcting for net efficiency. [Net efficiency varies from a maximum of about
        70% under clear water conditions; net efficiency declines when algal blooms are dense
        (Lathrop, R.C. 1998. Water clarity responses to phosphorus and Daphnia in Lake Mendota.
        Ph.D. Thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison.)] Organism densities in number per cubic
        meter can be obtained by dividing the reported square-meter density by the tow depth,
        although adjustments for the oxygenated depth zone during the summer and early fall
        stratified season is required to obtain realistic zooplankton volumetric densities in the
        lake's surface waters. Biomass densities can be calculated using literature formulas for
        converting organism body lengths reported in the database to body masses. Sampling
        Frequency: bi-weekly during ice-free season from late March or early April through early
        September, then every 4 weeks through late November; sampling is conducted usually once
        during the winter (depending on ice conditions). Number of sites: 4 Note: for a period
        between approximately 2011 and 2015, a calculation error caused density values to be
        significantly greater than they should have been for the entire dataset. That issue has been
        corrected.

           We collect zooplankton samples at the deepest part of the lake using two different
            gear types. We take one vertical tow with a Wisconsin Net (80um mesh), and a series of
            Schindler Patalas (53um mesh) samples spanning the water column. All samples are
            preserved in cold 95percent EtOH.After collection we combine subsamples of the
            individual Schindler Patalas trap samples to create one hypsometrically pooled sample
            for each lakeordate. The individual depth samples are discarded after pooling except
            from one August sampling date per year. The Hypsometrically Pooled sample and the
            Wisconsin Net sample are archived in the UW Zoology museum.We count zooplankton in one
            or two subsamples, each representing 1.8L of lake water, of the hypsometrically pooled
            samples to calculate zooplankton abundance. We count one sample date per month from the
            open water season, and the February ice cover sample.  We identify individuals to genus
            or species, take length measurements, and count eggs and embryos.Protocol log: 
            1981-May1984 -- a 0.5m high, 31L Schindler Patalas trap with 80um mesh net was used. Two
            Wisconsin Net tows were collected. Preservative was 12percent buffered formalin.June1984
            -- changed to 53um mesh net on Schindler trap.July1986 -- began using the 2m high, 45L
            Schindler Patalas trap. Changed WI Net collection to take only one tow.2001 -- changed
            zooplankton preservative from 12percent buffered formalin to 95percent EtOH.The number
            of sample dates per year counted varies with lake and year, from 5 datesoryear to 17
            datesoryear.1981-1983 -- pooled samples are of several types: Total Pooled (TP) were
            created using equal volume subsamples of the Schindler samples. Epi, Meta, Hypo pooled
            used equal volume subsamples from the Schindler samples collected from each of the
            thermal strata. Strata Pooled used equal volume subsamples from the Epi, Meta, Hypo
            pooled samples to create an entire lake sample. Hypsometrically Pooled (HP) is our
            standard, which uses subsample volumes weighted to represent the hypsometry of the lake.
