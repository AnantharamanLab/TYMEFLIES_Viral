    2023-08-08      Parameters characterizing the major ions of the eleven primary lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, Trout, bog lakes 27-02 [Crystal Bog], and 12-15 [Trout Bog], Mendota, Monona, Wingra and Fish) are measured at one station in the deepest part of each lake at the top and bottom of the epilimnion, mid-thermocline, and top, middle, and bottom of the hypolimnion. These parameters include chloride, sulfate, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, manganese, and specific conductance (northern lakes only). Lake Wingra has always been just a surface sample, but in the winter we have, at times, taken chloride samples from top to bottom to have a better understanding of road salt effects.
      Samples for conductivity are collected four times per year in the seven primary lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, and Trout lakes, and unnamed lakes 27-02 [Crystal Bog], and 12-15 [Trout Bog] in the Trout Lake area at the deepest part of the lake, sampling at the surface, mid water column, and the bottom. The sampling dates include February under ice, spring mixis, August stratified, and fall mixis.  Conductivity is measured using a YSI Model 32 conductivity meter with YSI 3403 conductivity cell, reported as uS/cm at 25Â°C.
      1981-1988: a Sybron Barnstead conductivity bridge was used. 1981-1986: conductivity was measured monthly.
      Sampling Frequency: quarterly (winter, spring and fall mixes, and summer stratified periods) Number of sites: 11

                  Chloride, Sulfate
          Samples for chloride and sulfate are collected together with a peristaltic pump and tubing and in-line filtered through a 0.45 micron filter capsule (0.45 micron polycarbonate filter before 2015) into new, 20 ml HDPE plastic containers with conical caps. The samples are stored refrigerated at 4 degrees Celsius until analysis, which should occur within 6 months. The samples are analyzed for chloride (and sulfate) simultaneously by Ion Chromatography, using a hydroxide efluent. The detection limit for chloride is approximately 0.01 ppm and the analytical range for the method extends to 100 ppm. The detection limit for sulfate is approximately 0.01 ppm and the analytical range for the method extends to 60 ppm. Method Log: Prior to January 1998 samples, chloride was determined on a Dionex DX10 Ion Chromatograph, using a chemical fiber suppressor. From 1998 to 2011, chloride was determined by a Dionex model DX500, using an electro-chemical suppressor. From January 2011 until present, chloride is determined by a Dionex model ICS 2100 using an electro-chemical suppressor.
          Calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, and manganese
          Samples for calcium analysis (as well as dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, and manganese) are collected together with a peristaltic pump and tubing and in-line filtered through a 0.45 micron filter capsule (0.45 micron polycarbonate filter before 2015) into 120 ml LDPE bottles and acidified to a 1percent HCl matrix by adding 1 ml of ultra pure concentrated HCl to 100 mls of sample. For every sample acidification event, three acid blanks are created by adding the same acid used on the samples to 100 mls of ultra pure water supplied from the lab. Once acidified, the samples are stable at room temperature until analysis, which should occur within one year. Until acidification, the samples should be refrigerated at 4 degrees Celsius. Calcium, as well as magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, and manganese are analyzed simultaneously on an optical inductively-coupled plasma emission spectrophotometer (ICP-OES). The acidified samples are directly aspirated into the instrument without a digestion. Calcium is analyzed at 317.933 nm and at 315.887 nm and viewed axially for low-level analysis and radially for high level analysis. The detection limit for calcium is 0.06 ppm with an analytical range of the method extends to 50 ppm. The detection limit for iron is 0.02 ppm with an analytical range of the method extends to 20 ppm. The detection limit for magnesium is 0.03 ppm with an analytical range of the method extends to 50 ppm. The detection limit for manganese is 0.01 ppm with an analytical range of the method extends to 2 ppm. The detection limit for potassium is 0.06 ppm with an analytical range of the method extends to 10 ppm. The detection limit for sodium is 0.06 ppm with an analytical range of the method extends to 50 ppm. Method Log: Prior to January 2002, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, and manganese were determined on a Perkin-Elmer model 503 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Lanthanum at a 0.8percent concentration was added as a matrix modifier to suppress chemical interferences. From January 2002 to April 2019, samples were analyzed for calcium on a Perkin-Elmer model 4300 DV ICP. From May 2019 to present, samples are run on an Agilent 5110 VDV ICP-OES.

      
      
                  Samples for conductivity are unfiltered water collected four times per year at the deepest part of the lake. Water is collected from the surface, mid water column, and the bottom using a peristaltic pump and tubing.  Samples are kept cold and dark until analysis, which occurs within one week of sample collection.  Just prior to measurement, the samples are warmed to 25 degrees Celsius in a water bath. Sample conductivity and temperature are measured using a YSI Model 32 conductivity meter equipped with a YSI 3403 conductivity cell and YSI 3220 temperature sensor.  A 1400 uS/cm standard is used to calculate the cell constant.  In addition to the lake water samples,  10 and 100 uS/cm standards are run as quality control check samples.
          EQUATIONS FOR CALCULATING CELL CONSTANT AND SAMPLE CONDUCTIVITY
          Conductivity is routinely reported as a value corrected to 25 C. This correction is represented in the following equations as:   (CM)(25 - T)(0.0191)
          where: CM = measured conductivity, T = measured temperature (C)
          Calculation of Cell Constant:
          K = ST/CA where: K = cell constant; ST = true conductivity of standard; CA = calculated conductivity of standard.
          Calculation of Sample Conductivity: CA = K{CM+(CM)(25-T)(0.0191)}
