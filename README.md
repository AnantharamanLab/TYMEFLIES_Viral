# TYMEFLIES_Viral
The repository store scripts for the project of "TYMEFLIES_Viral" - Study of the viral population based on 20-year time series metagenome data from Lake Mendota, Madison, Wisconsin, United States  (metagenomes are obtained from lake water from pelagic integrated epilimnion zone)

Scripts (including some of the inputs/outputs) are placed in the following folders:

### 1 Processing the datasets

Copy and rename fastq file, get the reads number and nt base name for each metagenome, copy files, run bbmap mapping to get "covstat" file for a subset of metagenomes.
