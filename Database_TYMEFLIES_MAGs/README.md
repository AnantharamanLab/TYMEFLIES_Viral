In 471 TYMEFLIES metagenomes, there are 416 having corresponding MAGs that were generated by IMG platform.  IMG incorporates the results of automated metagenome binning using MetaBAT along with CheckM and other quality assessment metrics for ensuring bin data quality. 



[Side06.get_statistics_for_all_MAGs.pl]

Get the statistics for all MAGs from TYMEFLIES project, including GTDB tax, Genome completeness, Genome contamination, and scaffolds (separated by ","). The GTDB tax format was changed from the original to format like:

```
d__Bacteria;p__Proteobacteria;c__Gammaproteobacteria;o__Betaproteobacteriales;f__Burkholderiaceae;g__Polynucleobacter;s__
```



In total, there are 12423 MAGs (containing 3403717 contigs) in this database.
