# TYMEFLIES MAGs

TYMEFLIES MAGs (for [Host prediction](https://github.com/AnantharamanLab/TYMEFLIES_Viral/tree/main/Host_prediction)) 

In 471 TYMEFLIES metagenomes, we've obtained 85,684 MAGs by reconstructing genomes from individual metagenomes. After genome completeness and contamination checking by CheckM2 v1.0.2, 30,389 MAGs were retained. Furthermore, TYMEFLIES representative MAGs (2,855 MAGs in total) were picked by dereplicating genomes with 96% sequence identity cutoff.

The taxonomy of MAGs were generated by running GTDB-Tk v2.1.1 with the database of release207_v2



[script] Side35.get_stat_of_MAG_passing_checkM_and_rep_MAG.py

Parse to get the statistics of MAGs that passed the CheckM2 completeness and contamination criterion, and parse to get the statistics of TYMEFLIES representative MAGs

The TYMEFLIES representative MAG statistical result ("Robin_MAG_stat.CheckM_passed.txt") was provided. It includes the following five columns: "Bin ID", "GTDB-Tk lineage", "Bin Completeness", "Bin Contamination", and "Scaffolds".
