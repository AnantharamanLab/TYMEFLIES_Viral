# Cluster vMAGs

**1 Cluster vMAGs**

Using dRep to cluster phage genomes in this study and vOTU representatives.

We used the vOTU representatives from 935362 vOTUs from IMG_VR_2020-10-12_5.1 - IMG/VR v3.

The methods to process the dataset of IMG_VR_2020-10-12_5.1 and get vOTU representatives were placed in folder "".

Phage genomes and vOTU representatives were placed together as the input genomes for "dRep dereplicate".

For "dRep dereplicate" settings for clustering phage genomes, please see the annotation information within the script.
